# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

### Project Description:

This project was created as part of the Sigma Technology Academy. The aim of the project is to have some fun with a terminal based Rock-Paper-Scissors game.

### Structure:

### Tech Stack:

Python

## Usage:

The usage of the game is fairly simple. You have to use a code editor's terminal window. Python MUST be installed on your computer. You can clone the repo from here and after that you have to navigate to the folder where the repo is located at and type the following (on windows): "python app.py".

## Playing a round:

After launching the game it will prompt you for a username where you can type username you like. The next step is to choose your weapon for the first round which can either be rock, paper or scissors. Based on your and the computer's choice the game calculates and outcome and gives 1 point to the winner of that round. The game is played until someone reaches 3 points in total.

## Future development:

There is a plan to make a simple GUI for the game so that it feels nicer to play.
